# Telegram BOT for Home Automation

Using Telegram's BOT api platform, I created a system that could allowed me to remotely control and manage my house. The project was tested on a scaled model. The goal was to develop a free domotic system that could use a preexisting communication platform (Telegram messaging app).A server was used as centralized node between house's sensors/switches and Telegram's servers. All the data was sent through HTTPS Protocol to insure security.
This system allows easy scalability and maintenance because the application is entirely server-side. Used languages: PHP, Arduino language, and SQL.

## Getting Started

Add server/html files to your https Server directory.
Edit the config.php file with TelegramÂ® BOT API Token, BOT ID, Owners ID Toekns and various IoT device Addresses.
Make sure your support SSL/TLS. Telegram only allow you communication through Https.
